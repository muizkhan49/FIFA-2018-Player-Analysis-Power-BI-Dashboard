# FIFA-2018-Player-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard
This project dives into the FIFA 2018 player dataset, containing detailed information about footballers such as their physical attributes, technical skills, wages, potential, and overall performance. The objective is to explore the dataset and uncover actionable insights through interactive Power BI visualizations.

🧠 Problem Statement

The goal is to approach the dataset as a football manager or data analyst, answering practical and strategic questions such as:

1.Which countries produce the most top-level footballers?

2.What is the age range where players peak in performance?

3.Which offensive positions (ST, RW, LW) command the highest wages?

4.Who were the top 5 players per position in 2018, based on potential and overall rating?

5.Are player wages influenced by potential?

6.Do strikers exhibit more aggression than defenders?

7.Which clubs are hubs for future superstars?

8.How do top clubs like FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, etc., pay their players?
